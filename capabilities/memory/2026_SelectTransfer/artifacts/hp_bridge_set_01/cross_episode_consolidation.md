# Cross-Episode Consolidation

## Source Set
- source_set_id: hp_bridge_set_01
- cluster: bridge

## Shared Structure
- **Multi-Hop Entity Chaining**: All tasks require traversing a chain of at least two distinct entities (e.g., Event → Venue, Song → Artist, Film → Actor) to reach the final answer.
- **Explicit Linking via Titles**: The reasoning path is anchored by specific entity titles (e.g., "Tivolis Koncertsal", "Wilmslow Show") that serve as the bridge nodes connecting the query context to the knowledge base.
- **Attribute Extraction from Secondary Context**: The target attribute (e.g., opening date, designation, birth year) is rarely found in the sentence describing the primary query entity; it resides in the supporting sentence of the linked entity.
- **High Difficulty via Indirection**: The "hard" difficulty rating correlates directly with the necessity of resolving the intermediate entity before the final fact can be retrieved.

## Applicability
- **Use when**: The question explicitly asks for a property of an entity that is not directly mentioned in the query, requiring the model to identify a related entity first (e.g., "Where is X located?" where X is an event, not a place).
- **Use when**: The supporting evidence contains a list of works or roles for an entity, and the query targets a specific item within that list to derive a new fact.
- **Avoid when**: The answer is contained within a single sentence describing the queried entity without requiring a jump to a different entity's profile.
- **Avoid when**: The relationship between entities is implicit or requires external world knowledge not present in the provided supporting sentences (e.g., knowing that a specific school is a venue without it being stated).

## Operational Heuristic
1. **Identify the Gap**: Determine if the requested attribute (date, name, role) is absent from the sentence describing the main subject of the question.
2. **Locate the Bridge Entity**: Scan supporting titles and sentences for an entity explicitly linked to the main subject (e.g., "held at", "directed by", "by").
3. **Retrieve Linked Context**: Extract the full profile or relevant sentences for this bridge entity.
4. **Extract Final Attribute**: Search the bridge entity's context for the specific attribute requested in the original question.

## Boundary / Failure Risk
- **Ambiguous Links**: Failure occurs if the supporting text mentions a relationship (e.g., "actor in a film") but does not explicitly name the specific film or attribute needed to proceed to the next hop.
- **Title Mismatch**: Errors arise if the model conflates similarly named entities (e.g., different films or venues) when the bridge relies on a specific title match.
- **Missing Intermediate Step**: The model may attempt to answer directly from the first sentence, failing to recognize that the answer requires data from a secondary entity's description.
- **Over-Reliance on Titles**: If the bridge entity is not listed in the "Supporting Titles" but is only mentioned in passing within a sentence, the standard retrieval path may fail.
